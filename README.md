# foundationyear
Foundation year computer science final project to develop a website which provides information about the course and the school. The purpose of which is to present the skills we have gained from the 2nd Semester labs.

We are using BASH to aid and accelerate the development of the website and HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the website itself. This is to demonstrate that we can implement the scripting and mark-up language skills we gained from the labs.

Anyone is free to use the code we have written here, provided credit is given and it is not commercially redistributed, though I doubt anyone would want to use our janky code. All rights are held by the University of Manchester School of Computer Science.
